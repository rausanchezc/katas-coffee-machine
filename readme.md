# __[Coffee Machine Project](https://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/)__

## Introduction

This mini project is used to learn Test Driven Development.

Of course, in your career, you have implemented more complicated stuff than a simple coffe machine that takes orders. 
But to make this mini project more interesting here are simple rules you must follow:

1. All production code is written to make a failing test pass
2. Do the simplest thing that could work for the current iteration

## Project 

In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee machine to the drink maker. 
Your code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker.

### Important!

You do not have to implement the coffee machine customer interface. For instance, your code could consume a simple POJO that would represent an order from a customer.

You do not have to implement the drink maker. It is only a imaginery engine that will receive messages according to the protocol. Your job is to build those messages.

### Iterations

This project starts simple and will grow in added features through the iterations.

+ First iteration: Making Drinks (~30 minutes)
+ Second iteration: Going into business (~20 minutes)
+ Third iteration: Extra hot (~20 minutes)
+ Fourth iteration: Making money (~20 minutes)
+ Fifth iteration: Running out (~20 minutes)

## Ready? 

### Requirements

+ Your favorite IDE or text editor
+ A testing framework (junit, rspec, ...)
+ A mocking framework (mockito, ...)
+ A passion for tested code ;)

Are you ready? So start the [first iteration](https://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/cm-first-iteration.html). Your product owner is waiting for you!
